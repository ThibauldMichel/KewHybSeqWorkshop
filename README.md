## Workshop Description

Hyb-Seq ([Weitemier et al., 2014](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3732/apps.1400042)) combines targeted sequencing of thousands of low-copy nuclear exons and flanking regions evolving across a range of different rates —as well as genome skimming of high-copy repeats and organellar genomes— to efficiently produce genome-scale data sets for phylogenomics. A new angiosperm-wide Hyb-Seq enrichment probe kit is being developed at Kew (in collaboration with [MYcroarray](mycroarray.com)), in the context of [PAFTOL](http://science.kew.org/strategic-output/plant-and-fungal-trees-life), based on transcriptome (generated by the [oneKP project](www.onekp.com)) and genome data ([Phytozome](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/)). This workshop will explain how to successfully implement Hyb-Seq all the way from kit design, to lab does and don’ts, data post-processing, and phylogenomic inference. 

## Workshop Objectives

Following the workshop, participants should be able to:
1.	Describe the entire HybSeq process, from bait design and lab work through phylogenetic analysis.2.	Design a HybSeq study and accurately estimate the cost to complete it.3.	Select appropriate markers for a HybSeq probe set.4.	Choose appropriate DNA extraction and library preparation strategies 5.	Decide on an appropriate pooling and sequencing strategy, taking into account both the cost savings and risks of increased multiplexing.6.	Assembly raw sequences into a usable data set.7.	Choose and carry out appropriate phylogenetic and/or population genetic analyses of assembled data.
