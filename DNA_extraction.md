#### DNA extraction and preparing samples for genomic library preparation.1.	Outline a plan for extracting DNA, quantifying it, performing quality-control, and preparing it for library preparation. For groups with herbarium specimens, discuss what issues might arise during sample preparation and how you might address them. Consider problems with DNA quantity, purity, and fragment size, along with any other considerations.2.	List the consumables you will need to purchase for no. 1 and estimate the total cost.3.	In preparation for the group discussion, discuss the following items relating to extracting DNA from herbarium specimens:*	What strategies have you used?*	What challenges have you faced?*	Have you dealt with any particularly challenging taxonomic groups (e.g., those with secondary compounds that confound DNA extraction)?*	Any other related issues you would like the groupâ€™s feedback on.
